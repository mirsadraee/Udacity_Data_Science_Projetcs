# Capstone Project - Starbucks Data
In this project, the Starbucks customer behaviour were analyzed. Starbucks distributes different type of offers to its memebers in order to motivate them for purchasing coffee or other products. There are different type of offers availables i.e. discount, inofrmational, BOGO, etc. and the members react to the offer differently. One may just view it when the other would  complete the offer. The offers have different difficulty, duration and reward. In this project, an analysis of the data was done and a machine learning tool was developed in order to predict the customer behaviour when they receive an offer from Starbucks.

The results of this study was published on medium under this [link](https://medium.com/@alireza.mirsadraee/udacity-capstone-project-investigation-of-starbucks-data-a600019a3653).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Starbucks is one of the most well-konwn chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves providing different coffees for different customers. Starbucks also provides different type of offers for its members in order to increase its sales and income. The people may receive an offer, in following they may open the offer and finally making purchases. There are some customers who do not receive any offer but still make purchases.   
The provided dataset by Starbucks has to be used in a way to identify which group of people are most responsive to each type of offer, so Starbucks can send the right offer to selected target group and hence decrease its advertisement costs and increase its sales considerably. It is possible to make a tool/model for predicting which customer reacts to which offer at best and will make purchase finally. This can be realized by developing a classifier using the provided the dataset and estimate the behavior of the customers.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
The standard data science libraries of Python are only needed. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.
